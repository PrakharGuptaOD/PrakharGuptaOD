# About Me

Hey there! I'm Prakhar 🐤

I'm someone who's deeply passionate about learning, teaching, and building communities that grow together. I believe in making education fun, friendly, and genuinely helpful—something that feels more like a conversation with a buddy than a boring lecture.

## 👨‍🏫 What I Do

I’m working on building something really special: the **Kselis Institute**. It’s an initiative focused on helping students discover their interests, build skills, and become confident learners. We want to be the kind of friend who helps younger students enjoy learning and stands by older students during the chaos of exams, college, and life.

I also run a super active **AI community**, with nearly 1000 members on WhatsApp and a Discord server with a discussion forum called **"AI Community (Coders High)"**. It’s a space where curious minds come together to explore, share, and grow in the world of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.

## 📚 My Learning Journey

Right now, I’m preparing for **IISER Aptitude Test**. I'm super focused on one topic at a time because that's how I roll. I'm also diving deep into:

- **Python programming** (from basics like lists and dictionaries to advanced DSA)
- **Statistics & Data Science**
- **Markov Chains**
- **Machine Learning (with sklearn & PyTorch)**
- **NLP and Deep Learning** (Transformers, RNNs, Attention Models—you name it!)

My goal is to not just learn, but to **understand deeply** and **explain clearly**. Analogies are my jam, and I like simplifying complex things in Hinglish whenever I can!

## 🎯 What Drives Me

- I'm obsessed with **helping others grow**.
- I love creating spaces where **questions are welcome** and learning is celebrated.
- I'm constantly chasing that “Aha!” moment—both for myself and for others.

## 🎵 A Little Extra

My favorite song? **Emotional Atyachar** 🎸  
Because hey, life is full of drama, and sometimes, you’ve just got to vibe with it.

Let’s learn, build, and grow together. 🚀
